Email Response Console for the Service Cloud
============================================

Introduction
------------
Email Response Console for Salesforce Service Cloud - or ERC – is a console tailored for agents that are focused primarily on email. The ERC can greatly improve agent productivity if...

- Your agents primarily respond to email
- The majority of your cases are “one and done”
- Salesforce Knowledge is a key resource for your email cases


The ERC is a collection of custom components for the Service Cloud Console tightly integrated with Salesforce Knowledge. With the ERC, agents can respond to emails leveraging Salesforce Knowledge on just one screen. This increases the productivity of your email focused Agents and improves call deflection by quickly getting the right knowledge article to your customers.
